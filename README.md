### QR Code Attendance V2

This project is a QR-based attendance system that utilitizes JSON data storage and allows for exports to CSV files

## Installation and Usage

Simply install the latest release (Only Windows supported as of now), unzip the zip file, and run the main.exe file. 
In order to use the app, you will have to input the member data into the left textbox under the Manage Members tab. Each member should have their own line, and each line should look like this 

<id>  <name> 
(ensure that the number and name are separated by a TAB, the decoder will not work otherwise)

After you've done this, simply restart the app, and you should see the updated member list on the main tab. By default, the app is intended to fit 40 members on the screen without scrolling, however, if there are more members, you will need to scroll down to view them.
